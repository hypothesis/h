About
-----

Hypothes.is brings community peer review to The Internet. It is a web
application which enables rich annotation of web content. The project acts as
a community aggregator for annotations and identity provider [*]_ for
annotators. It also serves embed code for an annotation agent designed with
modern web browsers in mind.

Installation
------------

See `<INSTALL.rst>`_ for installation instructions.

Running
-------

Installation has, hopefully, gone smoothly. If you ran into any problems, be
sure to seek help on IRC or the mailing list. To run the server, simply use
the ``run`` command::

    $ ./run

This command will start the server on port 5000 (https://0.0.0.0:5000),
reload the application whenever changes are made to the source code, and
restart it should it crash for some reason.

Development
-----------

The project builds heavily on components developed for the `Annotator Project`_
and is structured to encourage upstream contribution where possible. However,
work is required to make Annotator more extensible in order to facilitate
contribution.

Additionally, work is underway to support the data model described by the
`Open Annotation Core`_ specification document.

See the `project wiki`_ for the roadmap and additional information and
join us in `#hypothes.is`_ on freenode_ for discussion.

Those wishing to contribute to the project should also `subscribe`_ to the
development mailing list and read about `contributing`_.
