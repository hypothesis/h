- PDF documents can now be detected regardless of file extension (#2834).

Miscellanea

  signing in and saving it) could result in invalid permissions fields (#2687).

- Fix a problem in Safari where the search box didn't expand when you clicked on
  it (#2699).

- Fix improper case-sensitivity for tag searches (e.g. searches for "Tag123" now
  correctly return annotations tagged with "tag123") (#2690).

Features
--------

- Ignore the "gclid" query parameter (a Google AdWords click-tracking param)
  when normalising URLs (72f0509).

- Draft annotations are now preserved when switching from group to group in the
  sidebar (#2689).

Miscellanea

  semicolons in the page URL (6513184).

- The Chrome extension can now be built in a way that allows distinguishing

0.7.2 (2015-08-14)
==================

---------

- Fixed a regression that prevented infinite scroll from working on the stream.

--------

- Improve scrolling performance by using a fluidly sized body and scrolling
  the whole document rather than a fixed body.

- Rewrite infinite scroll pagination to use regular HTTP requests instead of
  WebSocket.

0.7.1 (2015-08-13)
==================

Bug fixes
---------

- Clicking on annotation cards and the navigational bucket indicators should
  work once more in the PDF.js viewer.

- Fixed an issue with timezone localization that caused unnecessary errors to
  be thrown and caught. Auditing this resulted in a removal of some significant
  bloat from unnecessary code.

Features
--------

- When sorting annotations by document location the TextPositionSelector
  information is now used instead of highlight position information. This
  causes less shuffling and re-rendering on load and when lazy-rendered pages
  in the PDF.js viewer appear and disappear at the cost of seeing annotations
  that have changed position or that target content within fixed position
  containers sometimes appear to be out of order.

- Removed an unnecessary call, originating in the infinite scrolling code, from
  the sidebar widget.

0.7.0 (2015-08-10)

- Support feature toggles for admins only.
  See https://github.com/hypothesis/h/pull/2435

- Improve the scrolling experience when clicking on bucket tabs and annotation
  cards. The view now scrolls so that the annotation is one fifth of the way
  down the screen, allowing room for navigation bars but leaving the annotation
  near the top of the screen.

- Support for the PDF.js viewer shipping in Firefox 40.

- Add a NIPSA service worker definition.

0.6.0 (2015-07-29)

  See https://github.com/hypothesis/h/pull/2381

- Fix an issue where failed document equivalence searches resulted in
  annotations on http://example.com/ being returned.
  See https://github.com/hypothesis/h/pull/2334

- Avoid some problems caused by annotating the application itself, such as
  by annotating the stream page.

- User experience and usability improvements.
  See https://github.com/hypothesis/h/pull/2330
  https://github.com/hypothesis/h/pull/2352 and
  https://github.com/hypothesis/h/pull/2349
