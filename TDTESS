<p class="calibre1">The Day the Earth Stood Still By Scott Derrickson  1.</p>
<p class="calibre1">FADE IN:</p>
<p class="calibre1">Darkness. The deep, eternal silence of space. A RING OF FIRE looms against the void.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We slowly MOVE around it &ndash; and the solar eclipse becomes a widening crescent.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As the MAIN CREDITS ROLL, a tiny object drifts slowly into frame, dwarfed by Earth’s immensity:</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE SPACE SHUTTLE ATLANTIS</p>
<p class="calibre1">drifts suspended in orbit at the edge of the Earth’s glow.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Its cargo bay doors slowly open.</p>
<p class="calibre1">A ROBOTIC ARM extends into space, releasing its payload &ndash; a DSCS-III listening satellite. The satellite tumbles free, drifting into its own orbit.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The cargo bay doors close and the Atlantis’ engines fire, propelling it onward to its next task.</p>
<p class="calibre1">We hear a signal: a strange atonal PULSE in space. The Atlantis follows the signal until it reaches its source &ndash;</p>
<p class="calibre1">&ndash; a SPHERE twelve feet in diameter, drifting in the satellite layer. It is encased in a thick layer of ice and dotted with impact craters, like a small moon.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Atlantis stands motionless before the Sphere. Its robotic arm stands poised in an empty gesture.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, slowly, the Sphere begins to move toward the Atlantis. It enters the cargo hold. The cargo bay doors slowly close.</p>
<p class="calibre1">INT. SPACE SHUTTLE &ndash; CARGO HOLD</p>
<p class="calibre1">A HISS as the airlock door opens. ASTRONAUTS in space suits emerge, pulling themselves through zerogravity into the hold.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, through the steam of the airlock, they see it:</p>
<p class="calibre1">THE SPHERE</p>
<p class="calibre1">looms in the cargo hold, held fast by hydraulic pistons designed to hold satellites in place.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Astronauts gaze upon the thing with bewildered eyes. Craters, valleys, mountains. An entire world in miniature.  2.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Droplets of water drift around the sphere: the ice is melting. A slab of ice comes free, revealing the perfect, glassy surface beneath.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Instinctively, the LEAD ASTRONAUT reaches out a gloved hand to touch the surface &ndash;</p>
<p class="calibre1">&ndash; and suddenly, as if by some unseen command, the hydraulic pistons begin to RETRACT, setting the sphere free. The Astronauts back off, as if afraid the thing might crush them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead it turns serenely on its axis before them. Then, suddenly, it stops &ndash;</p>
<p class="calibre1">&ndash; and we hear an off screen HISS. Red warning lights illuminate the hold. The Astronauts watch as the cargo hold doors open.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Astronauts head for the airlock, but the Lead Astronaut remains behind, gazing in wonder at the departing sphere. He reaches out instinctively, drifting after it &ndash;</p>
<p class="calibre1">&ndash; until finally he reaches the end of his tether, and can go no further.</p>
<p class="calibre1">IN HIS FACEPLATE</p>
<p class="calibre1">We watch as the sphere slips away, into the waiting void.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As it drifts out of frame, we look out onto the glowing blue planet beneath us &ndash;</p>
<p class="calibre1">&ndash; and see dozens of other spheres of various sizes falling from space and penetrating Earth’s atmosphere.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The shuttle’s bay doors slowly close before us, and we</p>

              If you said even ten years ago that

              The object is perfectly round.
              Therefore, it is not an asteroid.
              Besides, it is moving too fast.

<p class="calibre1">Look.</p>
<p class="calibre1">An eerie GLOW suffuses the Eastern sky. The white aura slowly grows, spreading through the dome of the heavens.</p>
<p class="calibre1">EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST &ndash; NIGHT</p>
<p class="calibre1">Scattered pedestrians carrying briefcases and shopping bags make their way home. A YOUNG MOTHER pushing a stroller glimpses something out of the corner of her eye. She stops and gazes into the sky &ndash;</p>
<p class="calibre1">&ndash; where the distant glow begins to coalesce, to focus itself into a small, intense point of light.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The light is moving across the sky, like a falling star &ndash; but this star is falling toward us.</p>
<p class="calibre1">One by one, more pedestrians stop and turn their faces to the sky, as the falling star traces its long, elegant parabola across the night. A crowd is gathering.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Drivers in cars crane their necks out their windows to see it. A Taxi driver gazes out his window, mesmerized.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The light moves through the sky, reflected in the mirrored glass of Midtown skyscrapers, as people look on in awe.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shafts of LENS FLARE shimmer endlessly in the night sky, and suddenly &ndash;</p>
<p class="calibre1">&ndash; it is here: a celestial presence looming large before us.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It begins to DECELERATE, visibly slowing down as it approaches. The awed murmur of the crowd becomes a stunned silence.  25.</p>
<p class="calibre1">EXT. CENTRAL PARK &ndash; OVERHEAD &ndash; NIGHT</p>
<p class="calibre1">It descends toward Sheep’s Meadow at an almost majestic pace, until it hangs suspended a few hundred feet from the ground. Central Park has become a great box of light.</p>
<p class="calibre1">EXT. 79TH STREET &ndash; NIGHT</p>
<p class="calibre1">Shafts of white starlight shimmer endlessly down the urban canyons: it is as if the city were illuminated from within.</p>
<p class="calibre1">EXT. CENTRAL PARK NIGHT</p>
<p class="calibre1">Every face is turned toward the light. The only sound is that of the autumn breeze through the trees. There is a long pregnant moment of silence, while the crowd below the sphere stares up in quiet awe.</p>
<p class="calibre1">As the light makes its final descent toward Sheep’s Meadow, a blast of powerful wind and white moisture blows a divot into the ground below, creating a tremendous BLAST of mist, dirt and debris. The sound is deafening.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It becomes a great roiling cloud that fills the whole of Central Park. The cloud envelops the fallen star, until it looks like a great earthbound thundercloud shot through with lightning.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It overcomes many of the onlookers below &ndash; even knocking some to the ground, raising scattered screams from the crowd.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The woman with the stroller grabs her baby just as the stroller is blown away.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, finally, the fallen star begins to dim, as if swallowed whole by the cloud.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The light is gone; the spell is broken. A ripple of fear and confusion moves through the crowd. SIRENS approach from every direction.</p>
<p class="calibre1">INT. CHINOOK HELICOPTER &ndash; NIGHT</p>
<p class="calibre1">The helicopter races toward the city. We enter the canyon of 79th street &ndash;</p>
<p class="calibre1">&ndash; to see that the distant plume of debris has become a great MUSHROOM CLOUD rising from the heart of Central Park.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Police and News HELICOPTERS buzz around the great cloud, their searchlights probing its darkness.  26.</p>
<p class="calibre1">EXT. 79TH STREET &ndash; NIGHT</p>
<p class="calibre1">The entire street has been barricaded off. The Chinook touches down at 79th and Madison. The bay door rolls open &ndash;</p>
<p class="calibre1">&ndash; and they climb out in their Hazmat suits. A Humvee loaded down with monitoring equipment is waiting for them.</p>
<p class="calibre1">They climb in and the Hazmat-suited DRIVER puts the truck in gear. At Fifth Avenue, we see that a cordon of National Guard vehicles has already sealed off Central Park.</p>
<p class="calibre1">INT. CENTRAL PARK &ndash; NIGHT</p>
<p class="calibre1">We enter the park and soon find ourselves at the edge of the great cloud. The Humvee rolls on until it can go no further.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen climbs out of the Humvee, a particulate monitor slung over her shoulder.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She enters the cloud of swirling dust and debris. All we hear is the sound of her BREATHING, and scattered bandlink transmissions in her earpiece.</p>

<p class="calibre1">She takes a few steps forward. We can see TINY LIGHTS gently pulsing like beacons through the fog.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She walks with careful steps in its direction. She stops and gazes up with wide, unseeing eyes, feeling its immensity, hearing its otherworldly HUM in her ears.</p>
<p class="calibre1">EXT. CENTRAL PARK &ndash; OVERHEAD &ndash; NIGHT</p>
<p class="calibre1">We take in the whole tableau: the cloud that has enveloped Sheep’s Meadow, the helicopters, the military vehicles and E.M.T’s that surround it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, silently, almost peacefully, A GENTLE BREEZE blows in off the river. It begins to stir the leaves on the trees.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Cloud begins to shift in the breeze. It ever-so-slowly drifts toward the West &ndash;</p>
<p class="calibre1">and, like a great curtain being drawn aside, it gradually reveals what lies beneath:</p>
<p class="calibre1">AN ENORMOUS SPHERE</p>
<p class="calibre1">stands on the meadow, illuminated by the searchlights of hovering helicopters.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It seems almost like a planet of its own: its surface teems with swirling gases and scattered sparks of lightning.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It looms forty stories high and forty stories wide. From high above, it’s as if Central Park were nothing more than a box designed to hold this strange jewel.</p>
<p class="calibre1">HELEN</p>
<p class="calibre1">stands in its shadow, overwhelmed. But now, as all the other scientists back away from the sphere in fear &ndash;</p>
<p class="calibre1">&ndash; Helen steps forward, instinctively moving towards it.  28.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She stares at it in mute reverence, as if it were the embodiment of dreams long abandoned.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the background, we can see MILITARY VEHICLES forming a perimeter around the sphere, their weapons poised against it.</p>
<p class="calibre1">MILITARY SNIPERS take up positions on nearby rooftops. SHOUTING VOICES can be heard on the radio:</p>

<p class="calibre1">A SILHOUETTED FIGURE steps into the opening.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen remains motionless as it emerges from the portal and slowly makes its way toward her. Now it comes into focus:</p>
<p class="calibre1">AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL BEING</p>
<p class="calibre1">a pale, grayish humanoid figure, with large dark eyes and an oversized head.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Helen gazes at it, eyes wide, her face bathed in light. At the sight of it, a single tear rolls down her cheek.</p>

<p class="calibre1"> 29.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Being gazes at her for a long moment. It reaches out to her with long, elegant fingers. The voices on the radio become a cacophony, building to a panicked crescendo:</p>
<pre class="calibre2"><code class="calibre3">              RADIO VOICES (V.O.) (CONT'D)</code></pre>
<p class="calibre1">It’s advancing!… if it gets any closer, prepare to fire… hold your fire, lower your weapons… do not, I repeat, do not… fire on my command… do not …</p>

<pre class="calibre2"><code class="calibre3">   RADIO VOICES (V.O.) (CONT'D)</code></pre>
<p class="calibre1">FIRE!</p>
<p class="calibre1">&ndash; and A GUNSHOT rings out. Helen’s suit is spattered with blood. The Being groans and collapses into her arms.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She crouches, holding it tightly in her arms, sheltering it from the gunfire. She reaches out for her radio:</p>
<pre class="calibre2"><code class="calibre3">              HELEN</code></pre>
<p class="calibre1">Stop! Don’t shoot!</p>

<p class="calibre1">Hold your fire. Hold your fire!</p>
<p class="calibre1">She gazes into its eyes, sees the pain of betrayal.</p>
<p class="calibre1">She crouches there, holding it as its blood spills out all over her suit. Then she hears something. She looks up &ndash;</p>
<p class="calibre1">&ndash; the atmospheric clouds on the sphere’s surface seem to darken before us. We feel that familiar rumbling again, but this time deeper, more menacing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">All eyes turn toward the sphere as it begins to GLOW, turning an angry reddish-orange, the whorls and eddies on its surface teeming like flares upon the surface of the sun, building brighter, almost blinding &ndash;</p>
<p class="calibre1">&ndash; until suddenly the chorus of static and walkie-talkies GOES DEAD.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Every light in the area &ndash; the sodium lights directed at the sphere, the headlights of the Humvees &ndash; all go dark.</p>
<p class="calibre1">An eerie SILENCE pervades. Then something emerges from the portal &ndash; sphere, something unlike anything we’ve ever seen.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Though it weighs several tons, it moves swiftly, gracefully on four legs, with a predatory, pantherlike gait.  30.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is covered in a steel-grey carapace: it seems neither animal nor machine, but some kind of IDOL, some primitive God.</p>
<p class="calibre1">And this God is angry.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It stands before the disabled war machines, rearing up, and it emits a high-pitched, piercing SOUND &ndash; or rather a chorus of sounds, like the teeming of a vast, angry swarm issuing from within its body.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The sound is devastating. Soldiers and scientists fall to their knees, covering their ears to block out the sound. It begins to approach the immobilized forces &ndash;</p>
<p class="calibre1">&ndash; when a strange VOICE is heard. The Being in Helen’s arms issues a hoarse COMMAND in an alien tongue &ndash; it reaches out with its hand, gesturing &ndash;</p>
<p class="calibre1">&ndash; and the Idol abruptly stops. It rises into an erect posture, folding its limbs in upon itself, until finally it stands dormant and motionless, like a great primitive totem.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The shrieking sound has ceased. Upon the Being’s command, the Sphere’s angry hue has dimmed, turned tranquil.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The strain of this effort has taken its toll on the Being in Helen’s arms. It begins to lose consciousness.</p>

<p class="calibre1">and a GURNEY careens headlong down the corridor, pushed by the medics. A shell-shocked Helen follows close behind.</p>

<p class="calibre1">INT. OPERATING THEATER</p>
<p class="calibre1">The Puccini Aria builds in intensity. Like a sculptor toiling over a slab of marble, the surgeon is utterly absorbed by his work. He occasionally glances skyward &ndash;</p>
<p class="calibre1">&ndash; to see the scientists looking down from above, expressions of utter incredulity on their faces.</p>
<p class="calibre1">CLOSE ON the surgeon’s gloved hand as it wrests something from within the Being’s very throat &ndash; the Being seems to choke as it’s wrested free</p>
<p class="calibre1">&ndash; and we reveal that it’s almost like a long umbilical cord.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The surgeon sets it aside and keeps working. He doesn’t even ask permission anymore. He just keeps cutting &ndash;</p>
<p class="calibre1">until, finally, his work is done. He steps back from the table, sets his scalpel aside, and looks up at the scientists above. The assembled scientists gaze down at the operating table, dumbstruck:</p>
<pre class="calibre2"><code class="calibre3">                                 HELEN
              It can't be.</code></pre>
<p class="calibre1">But it is. Now, finally, as the Aria reaches its crescendo, we PULL BACK to gaze down at the operating table from above, and we behold what remains:</p>
<p class="calibre1">A HUMAN BEING</p>
<p class="calibre1">lies on the operating table amidst scattered remnants of gray flesh.</p>
<p class="calibre1">It is in a nascent state, its body hairless, damp, and pale, weighing no more than ninety pounds.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Its limbs are twisted, contorted with the pain of its forced birth: a butterfly torn from its chrysalis.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The scientists stand there in silence, trying to fathom this thing, reeling at the implications. Finally, Granier turns to Helen:</p>
<pre class="calibre2"><code class="calibre3">                                 GRANIER

<p class="calibre1">Perhaps. But we still want to know everything about you.</p>

              represent?

                                 KLAATU
              I represent a group of civilizations.
