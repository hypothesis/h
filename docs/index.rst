Welcome to the Hypothesis Web Service’s Documentation!
======================================================

The `Hypothesis web service <https://github.com/hypothesis/h>` is the web app
that serves most of the https://hypothes.is/ website, including the web
annotations API at https://hypothes.is/api/.
The `Hypothesis client <https://github.com/hypothesis/client>`_
is a browser-based annotator that is a client for the web service's API, see
`the client's own documentation site <https://h.readthedocs.io/projects/client/>`_
for docs about the client.

This documentation is for:

* Developers working with data stored in the Hypothesis service.
* Contributors to the Hypothesis service and client.
