HTTP API
========

This document details the ``h`` application's public HTTP API. It is targeted at
developers interested in integrating functionality from Hypothesis into their
own applications.


root
----

.. http:get:: /api

   API root. Returns hypermedia links to the rest of the API.

   **Example request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      GET /api
      Host: hypothes.is
      Accept: application/json


   **Example response**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8

   :reqheader Accept: desired response content type
   :resheader Content-Type: response content type
   :statuscode 200: no error


search
------

.. http:get:: /api/search

   Search for annotations.

   **Example request**:

   .. sourcecode:: http

      GET /api/search?limit=1000&user=gluejar@hypothes.is
      Host: hypothes.is
      Accept: application/json

   **Example response**:

   Top-level annotations (but not replies) that match the search query are
   returned in the "rows" field. The "total" field counts the number of these
   top-level annotations. The "replies" field always contains all of the reply
   annotations to the top-level annotations in "rows".

   .. sourcecode:: http

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8

      {
          "rows": [
              {
                  "consumer": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
                  "created": "2014-01-12T18:36:15.697572+00:00",
                  "id": "LGVKq4E4SKKro1dBBEMwsA",
                  "permissions": { ... },
                  "references": ["6lkzoOubSOOymDNDIgazqw"],
                  "target": [],
                  "text": "Peut-etre",
                  "updated": "2014-01-12T18:36:15.697588+00:00",
                  "uri": "http://epubjs-reader.appspot.com//moby-dick/OPS/chapter_003.xhtml",
                  "user": "acct:gluejar@hypothes.is"
              }
          ],
          "total": 1,
          "replies": [
              {...}
          ]
      }

   :query limit: The maximum number of top-level annotations to return in
       "rows", for example: ``/api/search?limit=30``. (Default: 20)

   :query offset: The minimum number of initial top-level annotations to skip.
       This is used for pagination. For example if there are 65 annotations
       matching our search query and we're retrieving up to 30 annotations at a
       time, then to retrieve the last 5 do:
       ``/api/search?limit=30&offset=60``.  (Default: 0)

   :query sort: Specify which field the top-level annotations should be sorted
       by. For example to sort annotations by the name of the user that created
       them, do: ``/api/search?sort=user`` (default: updated)

   :query order: Specify which order (ascending or descending) the top-level
       annotations should be sorted in. For example to sort annotations in
       ascending order of created time (i.e. oldest annotations first) do:
       ``/api/search?sort=created&order=asc``. (Default: desc)

   :query uri: Search for annotations of a particular URI, for example
       ``/api/search?uri=www.example.com``. URI searches will also find
       annotations of *equivalent* URIs. For example if the HTML document at
       ``http://www.example.com/document.html`` includes a
       ``<link rel="canonical" href="http://www.example.com/canonical_document.html">``
       then annotations of ``http://www.example.com/canonical_document.html``
       will also be included in the search results. Other forms of document
       equivalence that are supported include rel="alternate" links, DOIs,
       PDF file IDs, and more.

   :query uri.parts: Search for annotations where any part(s) of the annotated
       URI match some text. For example ``/api/search?uri=example`` won't
       match any annotations because the ``uri`` field has to be the full
       URI ``www.example.com``, but ``/api/search?uri.parts=example``
       (or ``/api/search?uri.parts=example.com``) will find any annotations
       of ``www.example.com`` (or of any sub-pages like
       ``www.example.com/foo.html``).

   :query user: Search for annotations by a particular user. For example
       ``/api/search?user=tim``  will find all annotations by users named
       ``tim`` at any provider, ``/api/search?user=tim@hypothes.is`` will only
       find annotations by ``tim@hypothes.is``.

   :query text: Search for annotations whose body text contains some text,
       for example: ``/api/search?text=foobar``

   :query any: Search for annotations whose ``quote``, ``tags``, ``text``,
       ``uri.parts`` or ``user`` fields match some query text.
       For example: ``/api/search?any=foobar``.

   .. todo:: Document the ``document`` query parameter.

      This parameter is treated specially. We're holding off documenting it for
      now because upcoming work on document equivalence is likely to change it.

   You can also search for any other field that you see in annotations returned
   by the h API. Visit ``/api/search`` with no parameters to see some
   annotations and their fields. For example to search for all annotations
   with the tag "climatefeedback" do::

       /api/search?tags=climatefeedback

   or to search for all annotations that user ``seanh@hypothes.is`` has
   permission to delete do::

       /api/search?permissions.delete=acct:seanh@hypothes.is

   You can give any query parameter multiple times. For example
   ``/api/search?tags=climate&tags=feedback`` will only find annotations that
   have both the tags "climate" *and* "feedback".
