    actually deleted) from the database by the purge_deleted_annotations() task

    This is so that we can set a New Relic alert based on this metric so that
    we can know if the purge_deleted_annotations() task is unable to keep up
    (since it only deletes up to a limited number of annotations per task run)
    and we're failing to actually purge data from the database when users ask
    us to. Otherwise annotations could be marked as deleted but never actually
    purged and we'd never know.
