    <h2>Access denied</h2>
    <p>Maybe you are trying to access a local document, using the file:/// protocol, but forgot to grant the required permissions to the Hypothes.is extension?</p>
    <p>If that's the case, here is how to allow the Hypothes.is extension to access file URLs:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
	Go to <b>chrome://extensions</b> (Sorry, we can't make this clickable; you will need to type or copy this.)
      </li>
      <li>
	Check this checkbox called "Allow access to file URLs", as shown here: <br/>
	<img src="permission.png" />
      </li>
    </ol>
  <p>That still won't make local HTML documents useable (for now), but at least local PDF documents can be annotated this way.</p>
