## Building & Installing

To build this addon locally, you will need to
[install the Firefox Add-on SDK](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/SDK/Tutorials/Installation).

Then, from within this directory, run the following to test out the extension
in a standalone Firefox:

```
cfx run
```

Building an XPI version of the extension is just as simple:

```
cfx build
```
