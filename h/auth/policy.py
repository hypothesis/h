    An authentication policy for registered AuthClients

    Authentication for a request to API routes with HTTP Basic Authentication
    credentials that represent a registered AuthClient with
    grant type of ``client_credentials`` in the db.

    Authentication can be of two types:

    * The client itself:

      Some endpoints allow an authenticated auth_client to
      take action on users within its authority, such as creating a user or
      adding a user to a group. In this case, assuming credentials are valid,
      the request will be authenticated, but no ``authenticated_userid`` (and
      thus no request.user) will be set

    * A user within the client's associated authority:

      If an HTTP
      ``X-Forwarded-User`` header is present, its value will be treated as a
      ``userid`` and, if the client credentials are valid _and_ the userid
      represents an extant user within the client's authority, the request
      will be authenticated as that user. In this case, ``authenticated_userid``
      will be set and there will ultimately be a request.user available.

    Note: To differentiate between request with a Token-authenticated user and
    a request with an auth_client forwarded user, the latter has an additional
    principal, ``client:{client_id}@{authority}`` to mark it as being authenticated
    on behalf of an auth_client
