"""
Configure and expose the application database session.

This module is responsible for setting up the database session and engine, and
making that accessible to other parts of the application.

Models should inherit from `h.db.Base` in order to have their metadata bound at
application startup.

Most application code should access the database session using the request
property `request.db` which is provided by this module.
