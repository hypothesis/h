"""
The websocket server for Hypothesis.

This file contains a worker class for Gunicorn (:py:class:`h.websocket.Worker`)
and a stripped-down Pyramid application which exposes a single endpoint for
serving the "streamer" over the websocket.

Most of the code in this file: specifically the WebSocketWSGIHandler,
GEventWebSocketPool, and WSGIServer classes, are essentially lifted straight
from the ws4py codebase. We've made a number of modifications to fix bugs in
the (apparently unmaintained) ws4py code, and these are documented below:

1. Override WebSocketWSGIHandler.run_application due to the websocket server
   crashing with EBADF. A change in gevent (1.1) causes all sockets to be
   closed when a WSGI handler returns. ws4py starts a new greenlet for each
   new websocket connection used to return from the WSGI handler. The fix is
   taken from [1] and waits for the greenlet to finish before returning from
   the WSGI handler.

   [1]: https://github.com/Lawouach/WebSocket-for-Python/pull/180

   More information at:

   - https://github.com/Lawouach/WebSocket-for-Python/issues/170
   - https://github.com/gevent/gevent/issues/633

2. Fix GEventWebSocketPool so that if the set of greenlets changes while it is
   being closed it doesn't throw a "Set changed size during iteration"
   RuntimeError. See:

   - https://github.com/Lawouach/WebSocket-for-Python/issues/132
