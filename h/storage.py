Annotation storage API.

This module provides the core API with access to basic persistence functions
for storing and retrieving annotations. Data passed to these functions is
assumed to be validated.
"""

# FIXME: This module was originally written to be a single point of
#        indirection through which the storage backend could be swapped out on
#        the fly. This helped us to migrate from Elasticsearch-based
#        persistence to PostgreSQL persistence.
#
#        The purpose of this module is now primarily to serve as a place to
#        wrap up the business logic of creating and retrieving annotations. As
#        such, it probably makes more sense for this to be split up into a
#        couple of different services at some point.
