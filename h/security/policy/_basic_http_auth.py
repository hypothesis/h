    An authentication policy for registered AuthClients.

    Auth clients must be registered with grant type `client_credentials` and
    will need to perform basic HTTP auth with their username and password set
    to their auth client id, and secret.

    A client can also pass an `X-Forwarded-User` header with the userid to
    act as user in their authority. This will create a `request.user` and will
    look like a normal login. This user will have an additional
    principal, `client:{client_id}@{authority}` which lets you tell it apart
    from regular users.
