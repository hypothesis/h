# Once a feature has been fully deployed, we remove the flag from the codebase.
# We can't do this in one step, because removing it entirely will cause stage
# to remove the flag data from the database on boot, which will in turn disable
# the feature in prod.
#
# Instead, the procedure for removing a feature is as follows:
#
# 1. Remove all feature lookups for the named feature throughout the code.
#
# 2. Move the feature to FEATURES_PENDING_REMOVAL. This ensures that the
#    feature won't show up in the admin panel, and any uses of the feature will
#    provoke UnknownFeatureErrors (server-side) or console warnings
#    (client-side).
#
# 3. Deploy these changes all the way out to production.
#
# 4. Finally, remove the feature from FEATURES_PENDING_REMOVAL.
