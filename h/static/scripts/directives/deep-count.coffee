# @description
# `DeepCountController` exports a single getter / setter that can be used
# to retrieve and manipulate a set of counters. Changes to these counters
# are bubbled and aggregated by any instances higher up in the DOM. Digests
# are performed from the top down, scheduled during animation frames, and
# debounced for performance.
