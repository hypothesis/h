# @ngdoc service
# @name store
#
# @description
# The `store` service handles the backend calls for the restful API. This is
# created dynamically from the API index as the angular $resource() method
# supports the same keys as the index document. This will make a resource
# constructor for each endpoint eg. store.AnnotationResource() and
# store.SearchResource().
