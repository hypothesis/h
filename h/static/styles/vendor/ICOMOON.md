# Icon Fonts

The icon fonts for H were created with [icomoon](https://icomoon.io/app). The source file which contains the SVG definitions of the icons is `fonts/selection.json`.

The icons used are from the _Icomoon Free_ and [_Material Icons_](https://www.google.com/design/icons/) libraries which are both pre-installed in the icomoon app.

SVG icons should be used instead of the icon font for all new icons. The icon
font still exists in h to support content which has not yet been updated.
To render SVG icons, use the `svg_icon` function in Jinja templates.
