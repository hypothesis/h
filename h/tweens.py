    Convert HTTP response headers to native strings.

    The WSGI spec (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/) requires all
    HTTP response header names and values to be "native" strings:

    * Byte strings in Python 2
    * Unicode strings in Python 3

    Since string literals are byte strings in Python 2 and are unicode strings
    in Python 3, using string literals for header values (as in
    ``response.headers["Access-Control-Allow-Origin"] = "*"``) works fine in
    either Python 2 or 3.

    But once you add ``from __future__ import unicode_literals`` to a source
    code file the string literals become unicode strings in Python 2, and
    violate PEP-3333. This violation causes ``AssertionError``s from WebTest,
    and may cause problems with WSGI servers.

    This tween fixes that by converting all header names and values to native
    strings.
