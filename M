<p class="calibre1">Preface to Second Edition *</p>
<p class="calibre1">This dictionary is intended to be a reference book that gives reliable definitions or clear and precise explanations of mathematical terms. The level is such that it will suit, among others, sixth-form pupils, college students and first-year university students who are taking mathematics as one of their courses. Such students will be able to look up any term they may meet and be led on to other entries by following up cross-references or by browsing more generally.</p>
<p class="calibre1">The concepts and terminology of all those topics that feature in pure and applied mathematics and statistics courses at this level today are covered. There are also entries on mathematicians of the past and important mathematics of more general interest. Computing is not included. The reader’s attention is drawn to the appendices which give useful tables for ready reference.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Some entries give a straight definition in an opening phrase. Others give the definition in the form of a complete sentence, sometimes following an explanation of the context. An asterisk is used to indicate words with their own entry, to which cross-reference can be made if required.</p>
<p class="calibre1">This edition is more than half as large again as the first edition. A significant change has been the inclusion of entries covering applied mathematics and statistics. In these areas, I am very much indebted to the contributors, whose names are given on page v. I am most grateful to these colleagues for</p>
<pre class="calibre2"><code class="calibre3">                                16</code></pre>
<p class="calibre1">their specialist advice and drafting work. They are not, however, to be held responsible for the final form of the entries on their subjects. There has also been a considerable increase in the number of short biographies, so that all the major names are included. Other additional entries have greatly increased the comprehensiveness of the dictionary. The text has benefited from the comments of colleagues who have read different parts of it. Even though the names of all of them will not be given, I should like to acknowledge here their help and express my thanks. Christopher Clapham</p>

<p class="calibre1">Preface to Third Edition</p>
<p class="calibre1">Since the second edition was published the content and emphasis of applied mathematics and statistics at sixth-form, college and first-year university levels has changed considerably. This edition includes many more applied statistics entries as well as dealing comprehensively with the new decision and discrete mathematics courses, and a large number of new biographies on 20th-century mathematicians. I am grateful to the Headmaster and Governors of Belfast Royal Academy for their support and encouragement to take on this task, and to Louise, Joanne, and Laura for transcribing my notes.

<p class="calibre1">Since the third edition was published there has been a dramatic increase in both access to the internet and the amount of information available. The major change to this edition is the introduction of a substantial number of weblinks, many of which contain dynamic or interactive illustrations related to the definition. James Nicholson</p>

<p class="calibre1">Abel, Niels Henrik (1802&ndash;29) Norwegian mathematician who, at the age of 19, proved that the general equation of degree greater than 4 cannot be solved algebraically. In other words, there can be no formula for the roots of such an equation similar to the familiar formula for a quadratic equation. He was also responsible for fundamental developments in the theory of algebraic functions. He died in some poverty at the age of 26, just a few days before he would have received a letter announcing his appointment to a professorship in Berlin.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Abel’s test A test for the convergence of an infinite series which states that if ∑an is a convergent sequence, and {bn} is monotically decreasing, i.e.&nbsp;bn+1 ≤ bn for all n, then ∑anbn is also convergent.</p>

<p class="calibre1">written as f(a+) or .</p>
<p class="calibre1">abscissa The x-coordinate in a Cartesian coordinate system in the plane.</p>
<p class="calibre1">absolute address In spreadsheets a formula which is to appear in a number of cells may wish to use the contents of another cell or cells. Since the relative position of those cells will be different each time the formula appears in a new location, the spreadsheet syntax allows an absolute address to be specified, identifying the actual row and column for each cell. When a formula is copied and pasted to another cell, a cell reference using an absolute address will remain unchanged. A formula can contain a mixture of absolute and *relative addresses.</p>
<p class="calibre1">absolute error See ERROR.</p>
<p class="calibre1">absolute frequency The number of occurrences of an event. For example, if a die is rolled 20 times and 4 sixes are observed the absolute frequency of sixes is 4 and the *relative frequency is 4/20.</p>

<p class="calibre1">absolutely summable = ABSOLUTELY CONVERGENT.</p>
<p class="calibre1">absolute value For any real number a, the absolute value (also called the *modulus) of a, denoted by |a|, is a itself if a ≥ 0, and −a if a ≤ 0. Thus |a| is positive except when a = 0. The following properties hold:</p>
<ol class="calibre4">

<li class="calibre5"><p class="calibre1">|a − b| ≥ ||a| − |b||.</p></li>
<li class="calibre5"><p class="calibre1">For a &gt; 0, |x| ≤ a if and only if −a ≤ x ≤ a.</p></li>

<p class="calibre1">absorbing state See RANDOM WALK. 22 absorption laws For all sets A and B (subsets of some *universal set), A ∩ (A ∪ B) = A and A ∪ (A ∩ B) = A. These are the absorption laws.</p>
<p class="calibre1">abstract algebra The area of mathematics concerned with algebraic structures, such as <em class="calibre6">groups, </em>rings and <em class="calibre6">fields, involving sets of elements with particular operations satisfying certain axioms. The purpose is to derive, from the set of axioms, general results that are then applicable to any particular example of the algebraic structure in question. The theory of certain algebraic structures is highly developed; in particular, the theory of vector spaces is so extensive that its study, known as </em>linear algebra, would probably no longer be classified as abstract algebra.</p>
<p class="calibre1">abstraction The process of making a general statement which summarizes what can be observed in particular instances. For example, we can say that x2 &lt; x for 0 &lt; x &lt; 1 and x2 &gt; x for x &lt; 0 or x &gt; 1. Mathematical theorems are essentially abstraction of concepts to a higher level.</p>
<p class="calibre1">abundant number An integer that is smaller than the sum of its positive divisors, not including itself, For example, 12 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6, and 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16 &gt; 12.</p>
<p class="calibre1">acceleration Suppose that a particle is moving in a straight line, with a point O on the line taken as origin and one direction taken as positive. Let x be the <em class="calibre6">displacement of the particle at time t. The acceleration of the particle is equal to ẍ or d2x/dt2, the </em>rate of change of the *velocity with respect to t. If the velocity is positive (that is, if the particle is moving in the positive direction), the acceleration is positive when the particle is speeding up and negative when it is slowing down.</p>
<pre class="calibre2"><code class="calibre3">                                23</code></pre>
<p class="calibre1">However, if the velocity is negative, a positive acceleration means that the particle is slowing down and a negative acceleration means that it is speeding up.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the preceding paragraph, a common convention has been followed, in which the unit vector i in the positive direction along the line has been suppressed. Acceleration is in fact a vector quantity, and in the one-dimensional case above it is equal to ẍi.</p>
<p class="calibre1">When the motion is in two or three dimensions, vectors are</p>
<p class="calibre1">used explicitly. The acceleration a of a particle is a vector</p>
<p class="calibre1">equal to the rate of change of the velocity v with respect to t.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus a = dv/dt. If the particle has *position vector r, then</p>
<p class="calibre1">. When Cartesian coordinates are used, r = xi</p>
<ul class="calibre7">
<li class="calibre5">yj + zk, and then .</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre1">If a particle is travelling in a circle with constant speed, it still has an acceleration because of the changing direction of the velocity. This acceleration is towards the centre of the circle</p>
<p class="calibre1">and has magnitude where v is the speed of the particle and r is the radius of the circle.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Acceleration has the dimensions LT−2, and the SI unit of measurement is the metre per second per second, abbreviated to ’ms−2.</p>
<p class="calibre1">acceleration&ndash;time graph A graph that shows acceleration plotted against time for a particle moving in a straight line. Let v(t) and a(t) be the velocity and acceleration, respectively, of the particle at time t. The acceleration&ndash;time graph is the graph y = a(t), where the t-axis is horizontal and the y-axis is</p>
<pre class="calibre2"><code class="calibre3">                 24</code></pre>
<p class="calibre1">vertical with the positive direction upwards. With the convention that any area below the horizontal axis is negative, the area under the graph between t = t1 and t = t2 is equal to v(t2) − v(t1). (Here a common convention has been followed, in which the unit vector i in the positive direction along the line has been suppressed. The velocity and acceleration of the particle are in fact vector quantities equal to v(t)i and a(t)i, respectively.)</p>
<p class="calibre1">acceptance region See HYPOTHESIS TESTING.</p>
<p class="calibre1">acceptance sampling A method of quality control where a sample is taken from a batch and a decision whether to accept the batch is made on the basis of the quality of the sample. The most simple method is to have a straight accept/reject criterion, but a more sophisticated approach is to take another sample if the evidence from the existing sample, or a set of samples, is not clearly indicating whether the batch should be accepted or rejected. One of the main advantages of this approach is reducing the cost of taking samples to satisfy quality control criteria.</p>
<p class="calibre1">accuracy A measure of the precision of a numerical quantity, usually given to n <em class="calibre6">significant figures (where the proportional accuracy is the important aspect) or n </em>decimal places (where the absolute accuracy is more important).</p>
<p class="calibre1">accurate (correct) to n decimal places Rounding a number with the accuracy specified by the number of *decimal places given in the rounded value. So e = 2.71828 … = 2.718 to three decimal places and = 2.72 to two decimal places.</p>
<pre class="calibre2"><code class="calibre3">                                25</code></pre>
<p class="calibre1"> is 9.30 correct to two decimal places. Where a number of quantities are being measured and added or subtracted, using values correct to the same number of decimal places ensures that they have the same degree of accuracy. However, if the units are changed, for example between centimetres and metres, then the accuracy of the measurements will be different if the same number of decimal places is used in the measurements.</p>
<p class="calibre1">accurate (correct) to n significant figures Rounding a number with the accuracy specified by the number of *significant figures given in the rounded value. So e = 2.71828 … = 2.718 to four significant figures and = 2.72 to three significant figures. e−3 = 0.049787 … = 0.0498 correct to three significant figures. Rounding to the same number of significant figures ensures all the measurements have about the same proportionate accuracy. If the units are changed, for example between centimetres and metres, then the accuracy of the measurements will not be changed if the same number of significant figures is used in the measurements.</p>
<p class="calibre1">Achilles paradox The paradox which arises from considering how overtaking takes place. Achilles gives a tortoise a head start in a race. To overtake, he must reach the tortoise’s initial position, then where the tortoise had moved to, and so on *ad infinitum. The conclusion that he cannot overtake because he has to cover an infinite sum of well-defined non-zero distances is false, hence the paradox.</p>

<p class="calibre1">action limits The outer limits set on a *control chart in a production process. If the observed value falls outside these limits, then action will be taken, often resetting the machine.

<p class="calibre1">active constraint An inequality such as y + 2x ≥ 13 is said to be active at a point on the boundary, i.e.&nbsp;where equality holds, for example (6, 1) and (0, 13).</p>
<p class="calibre1">activity networks (edges as activities) The networks used in <em class="calibre6">critical path analysis where the edges (arcs) represent activities to be performed. Paths in the network represent the precedence relations between the activities, and </em>dummy activities are required to link paths where common activities appear, but the paths are at least partly independent. While this is a complication, each activity appears on only one edge and the sequence of activities needed is easier to follow than when the vertices are used to represent the activities. Once the activity network has been constructed from the precedence table, the *critical path algorithm (edges as activities) can be applied.</p>
<p class="calibre1">activity networks (vertices as activities) The networks used in *critical path analysis where the vertices (nodes) represent activities to be performed. The edges (arcs) coming out from</p>

<p class="calibre1">any vertex X join X to any vertex Y whose activity cannot start until X has been completed, and the edge is labelled with the time taken for activity X. Note that there will often be more than one such activity, in which case each edge will carry the same time. The construction of an activity network requires a listing of the activities, their duration, and the precedence relations which identify which activities are dependent on the prior completion of other activities. With this structure, <em class="calibre6">dummy activities are not needed, but the same activity will be represented by more than one edge when more than one other activity depends on its prior completion, and the sequence of activities is less easy to follow than the alternative structure </em>activity networks (edges as activities).</p>
<p class="calibre1">acute angle An angle that is less than a <em class="calibre6">right angle. An </em>acute-angled triangle is one all of whose angles are acute.</p>
<p class="calibre1">adders (in combinatorial circuits) The half-adder and full adders are sections of circuits which use a system of logic gates to add binary digits, by using a combination for which the truth table output is identical to the output required by the binary addition.</p>

<p class="calibre1">addition (of complex numbers) Let the complex numbers z1 and z2, where z1 = a + bi and z2 = c + di, be represented by the points P1 and P2 in the *complex plane. Then z1 + z2 = (a + c) + (b + d)i, and z1 + z2 is represented in the complex plane</p>

<p class="calibre1">addition (of directed line-segments) See ADDITION (of vectors).</p>
<p class="calibre1">addition (of matrices) Let A and B be m × n matrices, with A = [aij] and B = [bij]. The operation of addition is defined by taking the SUM A + B to be the m × n matrix C, where C = [cij] and cij = aij + bij. The sum A + B is not defined if A and B are not of the same order. This operation + of addition on the set of all m × n matrices is <em class="calibre6">associative and </em>commutative.</p>
