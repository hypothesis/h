Installing Hypothes.is with Vagrant
######################

Running Hypothes.is on a VM enables development on Windows machines, and also provides a "clean box"
for testing dependencies.  The following instructions will use Vagrant to create and manage
a VirtualBox Ubuntu VM with Hypothes.is and all its dependencies on it.

Install Vagrant
---------------

Use your package manager of choice, e.g.::

    $ sudo apt-get vagrant

or download from http://vagrantup.com.


Bootstrapping the VM
--------------------

From the home directory of the h project (this directory) ::

    $ vagrant up
    $ vagrant ssh

The first command creates the VM and starts it running, the second shells you into it.
From there, `cd /h` and follow the directions in ./INSTALL.rst.   That's it.

Notes on Using the VM
---------------------

* The vagrant commands are very simple: `vagrant up`, `vagrant ssh`, `vagrant halt`, `vagrant destroy`
  and a few others.  `vagrant help` for explanations.
  
* This vagrant configuration forwards port 5000 from the guest to the host.  This means that from your
  host machine (and from outside), "http://<hostname>:5000" will be routed to the h server on the VM.

* All the configuration is contained in `./Vagrantfile`.  In particular the exact set of software
  dependencies are encoded there, so `./Vagrantfile` will need to be updated if those change.


VM State
--------

VM state is normally preserved across runs (e.g. `vagrant halt` followed by `vagrant run`).
This includes the h server state (the annotation database), installed software, etc.  

In addition, the h directory (this directory) is mirrored on the VM (at `/h`).  Changes can be made to the directory
either on the host or the guest.  For example, you can edit code and invoke git while on the VM.

The command `vagrant destroy` destroys the current VM and its corresponding state, but does
not affect this directory.

The configuration
process is run each time the VM is brought up; if this gets annoying, it is possible to make a snapshot
of the VM and use that instead.


Notes for Windows Development
-----------------------------

If you are working with a Windows host, you want the shared directory to use Unix line endings.
Do that by configuring this git repository as follows::

    $ git config core.eol lf
    $ git config core.autocrlf input

You will probably also need to `git reset --hard` to re-extract all files with approproate line endings.
Do this *before* proceeding with bootstrapping.
