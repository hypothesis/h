This script can create an isolated environment for installing python
software libraries needed for development. This setup is recommended.

If you are not familiar with using virtualenv [1] to manage a python
development environment you may wish to take a few minutes to read a
bit about it.

If you are comfortable managing it yourself, e.g. through a tool
like virtualenv-wrapper [2], you may decline to create one now.
