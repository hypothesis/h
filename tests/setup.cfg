    # flake8-future-import's "__future__ import “*” missing' rules. We run a
    # separate flake8 command to run these rules because we want them to ignore
    # certain files, so disable them for our general flake8 command.
    #
    # This also disables flake8-future-import's '__future__ import “*” present'
    # rules. These will become useful once we've moved to Python 3.
